# Portfolio: setup and mobile version skeleton

"Your portfolio is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it‚Äôs the easiest way of showing what you‚Äôre truly capable of as a developer, and is a quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams." - Microverse

This project is the first step of building my portfolio. For this project, I have to pick one of the templates shared by the Microverse community on https://www.figma.com (I picked #2) and build it from scratch using what was learned about HTML and CSS.
