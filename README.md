# Portfolio

"Your portfolio is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it‚Äôs the easiest way of showing what you‚Äôre truly capable of as a developer, and is a quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams." - Microverse

This project consists in building my personal portfolio from scratch, choosing one of the [Microverse templates](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=1%3A1471) and sticking to that design (I chose Template 2). For this, I followed these steps:

1. Build the toolbar and headline sections of the mobile version.
2. Build the "Works" and "About me" sections of the mobile version.
3. Build the contact form and to finish the mobile version of the mobile version.
4. Build the desktop version.
5. Deploy the application in GitHub Pages.
6. Evaluate accesibility.
