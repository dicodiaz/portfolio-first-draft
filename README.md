# Portfolio: mobile version

"Your portfolio is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it‚Äôs the easiest way of showing what you‚Äôre truly capable of as a developer, and is a quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams." - Microverse

This project is the second step of building my portfolio. For this project, I have to build the "Works" and "About me" sections of the template picked in the first step ([I picked #2](https://www.figma.com)) from scratch using what we learned in previous HTML & CSS lessons.
